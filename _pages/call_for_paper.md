## Submission Guidelines
**Paper formatting:** Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and tables, in the CVPR 2026 style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Please download the [CVPR 2026 Submission Template](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/archive/refs/tags/CVPR2026-v1(latex).zip) for detailed formatting instructions.

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission and review process:** Review process is double-blind. We will be using OpenReview to manage submissions. Similar to the review process for [CVPR 2026 conference](http://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026), submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee. The reviews and author responses will never be made public, and we will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. 

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the paper submission deadline. We recommend you to use institution emails to register your account on Openreview, as non-institution emails can take upto two weeks to register. By submitting a paper to this workshop, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by the OpenReview system to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers.

OpenReview author instructions can be found [here](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026/CompleteYourORProfile).
